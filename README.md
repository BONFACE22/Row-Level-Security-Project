# Row-Level Security (RLS) Project

### Project Overview  
This project addresses the challenge of balancing data access across an organization by implementing a hierarchical, dynamic Row-Level Security (RLS) framework. Senior managers were granted full visibility into financial and sales reports, while the sales team was restricted to viewing only their own data. This solution has streamlined operations, improved efficiency, and fostered trust within the organization.

---

## Key Features  
- **Dynamic RLS Framework**: Tailored data access based on user roles.  
- **Hierarchical Access**: Senior managers have full access; sales teams see only their data.  
- **Efficiency Gains**: Saved hundreds of hours by automating data access controls.  
- **Scalable Solution**: Designed to accommodate future roles and data requirements.  

---

## Problem Statement  
Organizations often struggle with balancing data access. Senior managers need full visibility into financial and sales reports, while sales teams should only access their own data. Without a proper RLS framework, this can lead to inefficiencies, security risks, and operational bottlenecks.

---

## Solution  
A dynamic RLS framework was implemented to:  
1. **Restrict Data Access**: Sales teams can only view their own data.  
2. **Grant Full Access**: Senior managers have unrestricted access to all data.  
3. **Automate Security**: Reduce manual intervention and ensure compliance.  

---

## Implementation Steps  
1. **Data Modeling**: Designed a role-based hierarchy in Power BI.  
2. **DAX Formulas**: Created dynamic filters using DAX (e.g., `USERPRINCIPALNAME()`).  
3. **Testing**: Validated access for each role to ensure data security.  
4. **Deployment**: Published the solution to Power BI Service and configured RLS.

## Benefits  
- **Enhanced Security**: Ensured sensitive data is accessible only to authorized users.  
- **Improved Efficiency**: Reduced manual data filtering and access requests.  
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate future roles and data growth.  
- **Trust and Compliance**: Built confidence in data handling and met regulatory requirements.  

---

## Recommendations  
1. **Role-Based Training**: Educate users on how RLS impacts their data access.  
2. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review RLS configurations to ensure compliance.  
3. **Expand Use Cases**: Apply RLS to other datasets and departments.  

---

## Conclusion  
This RLS solution has transformed how data is accessed and managed within the organization. By implementing a dynamic, role-based framework, weâ€™ve enhanced security, improved efficiency, and fostered trust. Data analytics truly shines when it solves real-world problems like this one.

## Code Snippets  
### DAX Formula for Dynamic Filtering  
```DAX
Sales Data Filter = 
IF(
    USERPRINCIPALNAME() = "senior.manager@company.com", 
    TRUE(), 
    [Salesperson Email] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()
)
```
